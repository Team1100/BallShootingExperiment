# BallShooterExperiment
This is an experiment that will be used to aid the development of a ball shooter using
a wheel by logging the speed of the spinning wheel and attempting to keep the wheel
spinning at the same rate. This data should be collected in a file such that it can
be graphed and analyzed.
